### An educational example demonstrating the use case of the yt-dlp tool.

---

I created two variants of the same tool: automatic and manual. The automatic version reads a "songs.csv" file and looks up the songs listed in the file online. The manual version does not read any file; instead, it prompts you to enter the URL, artist, and title.
The script downloads the song itself, then attempts to download the album cover, album name, and song lyrics to embed this information into a single file.

Most common issue is getting a wrong album cover, I might fix it somewhere in the future. Rest of it works really well.
